// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

. Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is *CREATE_COMPLETE*, the Amazon Redshift cluster is ready.
. Use the URLs displayed in the *Resources* tab for the stack to view the resources that were created.

=== Test the deployment

==== Test whether the Redshift cluster is accepting connections

. From the AWS CloudFormation console, in the *Outputs* tab for RedshiftStack, note the values of RedshiftUsername, RedshiftDatabaseName, and RedshiftClusterEndpoint, as shown in the following figure.

[start=2]
. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/home[https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/].
. Choose *Query Editor* and enter your credentials to connect to the Redshift database, as shown in the following figure.

[start=4]
. After successful connection, run a sample query “select * from pg_user;”, as shown in the following figure.

==== Test whether the Linux bastion host is accepting connections

[start=5]
. Note down the Elastic IP address of the bastion host from the *Outputs* tab of the bastion stack, as shown in the following figure.

[start=6]
. Open a terminal window and connect to the bastion host by using SSH with the key pair that you specified during deployment, as shown in the following figure.

ssh -i "<EC2 key pair>" ec2-user@52.26.20.201

== Best practices for using Amazon Redshift

For detailed information about working with Amazon Redshift, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-who-should-use-this-guide.html[Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide].

Use AWS CloudFormation for ongoing management

We recommend using the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ to manage updates and deletions for the resources that are created by this Quick Start.

If you use the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or API to change or delete resources created by this Quick Start, future AWS CloudFormation operations on the stack might behave unexpectedly.
